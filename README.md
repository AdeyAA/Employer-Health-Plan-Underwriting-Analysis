# Project Overview
An Excel-based underwriting analysis to evaluate employer eligibility for health plans. The analysis looks at employee demographic risk, geographic eligibility, health risk proxies, and financial performance to assess underwriting viability. 

# Problem Statement
Employers considering alternative-funded health plans assume greater financial risk. Carriers require demographic stability, predictable claims, and acceptable risk concentration. This project simulates the underwriting pre-screening process used to determine eligibility and financial feasibility.
